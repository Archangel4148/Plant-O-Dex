    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Carex eburnea, sometimes commonly called bristle-leaf sedge, is native from Newfoundland to Alaska south to Virginia, Alabama, Arkansas and Texas. In Missouri, it most commonly occurs in crevices of limestone bluffs in the Ozark areas of the state (Steyermark). It is also known to grow in drier sandy soils, particularly on limestone outcroppings and glades. This sedge is grown in the landscape for its foliage effect. Soft, thread-like, green leaves form a spherical, porcupine-like clump to 6-10\u201d tall and as wide. Whitish-green flowers on spikes in spring are insignificant. Other common names for this sedge include ivory sedge and ebony sedge.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Specific epithet means ivory-white."
