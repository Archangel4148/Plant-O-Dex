    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Campanula rotundifolia, commonly called bluebell or harebell, is a rosette-forming, upright perennial that typically grows to 20\" tall. It is noted for producing attractive, bell-shaped, nodding blue flowers (each to 1/2\" long) that bloom singly or in small clusters from the stem tips throughout summer (June-September). This bluebell is native to a variety of different environments including meadows, grasslands, rocky slopes, crevices, alpine areas and sandy shores in the northern parts of North America, Europe and Asia. From a basal rosette of small, rounded, long-stalked, basal leaves (to 1\" wide) rise wiry, thread-like stems clad with narrow, alternate, linear leaves (each to 1-3\" long). Basal leaves usually wither early and disappear before the flowers form. This plant is also native to a small area in the Ozarks in Shannon County where it is found on north-facing limestone bluffs along the Jack's Fork River.Genus name comes from the Latincampanameaning bell in reference to the bell-shaped flowers.Specific epithet is in reference to the rounded basal leaves.This bluebell has a large number of common names. Harebell may relate to the fact that this plant is sometimes found in areas inhabited by rabbits (hares). This same plant grows in Scotland where it is popularly known as the bluebells of Scotland or Scotch bluebell."
