The fruits remain on the plant in winter, adding an interesting accent when the shadows reflect on snow. The grass-like leaves, which are up to 1/2\" wide, are semi-evergreen.Genus name from Latin means cutter in reference to the sharp leaves and stem edges (rushes are round but sedges have edges) found on most species' plants.Specific epithet honors Asa Gray (1810-1888), a leading American botanist and author of such great works as the notableGray's Manual of Botany(1848; 8th edition 1950)."
