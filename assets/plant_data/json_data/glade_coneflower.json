    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Echinacea simulata, commonly called wavyleaf purple coneflower or glade coneflower, is native to rocky, woodland openings, prairies, and glades primarily in the Ozarks with disjunct populations from Illinois and Indiana south through Kentucky and Tennessee to northern Alabama and Georgia. It is very similar to the more wide-spreadEchinacea pallida, except for the pollen color on the anthers:E. simulatais yellow, butE. pallidais white. Features very narrow, parallel-veined, toothless, dark green leaves (4-10\" long) and large, daisy-like flowers with drooping, pale pinkish-purple petals (ray flowers) and spiny, flattened-knob-like, coppery-orange center cones. Flowers appear on rigid stems to 3' tall over a long summer bloom. Best flower display is in late June to late July, with sporadic continued bloom into autumn. Good fresh cut or dried flower. The dead flower stems will remain erect well into the winter and, if flower heads are not removed, are often visited by goldfinches who perch on or just below the blackened cones to feed on the seeds.Genus name ofEchinaceacomes from the Greek wordechinosmeaning hedgehog or sea-urchin in reference to the spiny center cone found on most flowers in the genus.Specific epithet appears to refer to the plant's resemblance to or simulation ofE. pallida."
