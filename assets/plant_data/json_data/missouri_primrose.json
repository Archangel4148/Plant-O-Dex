    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Oenothera macrocarpa, commonly called Missouri evening primrose, is a sprawling, Missouri native plant which occurs on limestone glades and bluffs and rocky prairies in the Ozark region south of the Missouri River. Typically grows 6-12\" tall and features very large (3-5\" across), solitary, 4-petaled, mildly fragrant, bright yellow flowers which open for only one day (usually open late afternoon and remain open until the following morning). Flowers arise from leaf axils and are generally upward-facing, but sometimes rest on or touch the ground. Long spring to summer bloom period. Flowers are followed by somewhat unique, winged seed pods (2-3\" long). Narrow, lance-shaped leaves. This species was formerly called (and is still often listed for sale as)Oenothera missouriensis.Genus name is unclear but may have come from the Greek wordsoinosandtherasmeaning wine-seeker in probable reference to an ancient use of the roots of genus plants in scenting wine.Specific epithet means large-fruited."
