Grows 3-4' tall. Woolly-looking, white flower heads, each with 5 tiny ray flowers (1/12\" long), appear in broad, flat-topped, terminal corymbs from late spring to late summer. Leaves are glandular and aromatic with a rough texture to both surfaces. The leaf margins are toothed and mostly entire, although some may exhibit coarse lobes at the base. Long-petioled basal leaves are much larger than cauline leaves (leaves on the stem).The genus namePartheniumcomes from the Greek meaning \"virgin\", in reference to the fertile ray florets and infertile disk florets of species in this genus.The specific epithetintegrifoliummeans \"with entire or uncut leaves\"."
