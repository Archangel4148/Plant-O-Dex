    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Liatris pycnostachya, commonly called prairie blazing star, is perhaps the tallestLiatrisspecies in cultivation, typically growing 2-4' tall (infrequently to 5'). It is an upright, clump-forming, Missouri native perennial which commonly occurs in prairies, open woods, meadows and along railroad tracks and roads. Features rounded, fluffy, deep rose-purple flower heads (each to 3/4\" across) which are crowded into terminal spikes (to 20\" long) atop thickly-leafed, rigid flower stalks. Stalks arise from basal tufts of narrow, lance-shaped leaves (to 12\" long). Flowers generally open top to bottom on the spikes. Blooms in summer. The flowers are attractive to hummingbirds, butterflies, and other pollinators, and the small seeds are attractive to songbirds. This species is distinguished from otherLiatrisspecies by its reflexed, long-tipped involucral bracts.Genus name of unknown origin.Specific epithet means crowded in Greek, in probable reference to the arrangement of both flower heads and leaves.Liatrisbelongs to the aster family, with each flower head having only fluffy disk flowers (resembling \u201cblazing stars\u201d) and no ray flowers. The feathery flower heads of liatris give rise to another common name of gayfeather."
