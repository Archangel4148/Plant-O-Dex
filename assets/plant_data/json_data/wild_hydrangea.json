    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Hydrangea arborescens, commonly known as smooth hydrangea or wild hydrangea, is a loosely and widely branched deciduous shrub that typically grows to 3-6\u2019 (less frequently to 10\u2019) tall.  It is native to moist or rocky wooded slopes, ravines, streambanks and bluff bases from New York to Florida west to Iowa, Missouri, Oklahoma and Louisiana.  Gray-brown stems are clad with opposite, broad egg-shaped to rounded, sharply toothed, dark green leaves (2-6\u201d long) with pale green undersides.  Leaves turn yellow in fall.  Tiny white fertile flowers bloom in May-July in flattened hairy clusters (corymbs to 2-6\u201dacross).  Scattered continuing flowering may occur throughout summer to September.  A few large sterile flowers usually appear at the cluster margins (usually not enough for a quality lacecap effect).  Flowers give way to dehiscent seed capsules which ripen in October-November.The genus nameHydrangeacomes fromhydormeaning \"water\" andaggeionmeaning \"vessel\", in reference to the cup-like capsular fruit.Specific epithet comes fromarbormeaning \"tree\" in reference to the similarity of this shrub to a small tree."
