    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Baptisia sphaerocarpa, commonly called false indigo (or yellow wild indigo) is an upright, mounded perennial that typically grows 2-3\u2019 tall. It is native to open habitats along the Gulf Coasts of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi north through Oklahoma and Arkansas to Missouri. It features small, yellow, pea-like flowers (to 1/2\u201d long) in erect racemes (to 12-15\u201d) atop yellowish-green flower stems extending well above a foliage mound of clover-like, trifoliate, blue-green leaves (leaflets to 2\u201d long). Blooms in spring. Flowers give way to inflated spherical seed pods (to 3/4\u201d diameter) that turn tan to brown when ripe and have considerable ornamental interest. Stems with seed pods are valued additions to dried flower arrangements.The genus nameBaptisiacomes from the Greek wordbaptomeaning \"to dye\".Specific epithet means with rounded fruit."
