    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Liatris scariosa, commonly called blazing star, is an upright, clump-forming perennial that typically grows to 2-4\u2019 tall in the wild. It is native from Maine to Wisconsin south to Mississippi and Georgia. In Missouri, it is uncommonly found in rocky woods, rocky slopes, prairies, and gravel areas along streams (Steyermark). Fluffy, thistle-like, reddish-purple flower heads (to 1\u201d across) bloom in late summer to early fall on terminal columnar inflorescences (to 18\u201d long) atop erect, leafy flower stems. Inflorescences are of the button type (individual flower heads are spaced along the stem on short stalks). Inflorescences bloom from top to bottom. Flowering stems rise up from basal tufts of rough, narrow, ovate to lanceolate, green leaves (to 10\u201d long). Stem leaves (to 3\u201d long) are much smaller. The flowers are attractive to hummingbirds, butterflies, and other pollinators, and the small seeds are attractive to songbirds.Genus name of unknown origin.Specific epithet means shrivelled.Liatrisbelongs to the aster family, with each flower head having only fluffy disk flowers (resembling \u201cblazing stars\u201d) and no ray flowers. The feathery flower heads of liatris give rise to another common name of gayfeather."
