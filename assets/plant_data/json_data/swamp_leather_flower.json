In Missouri, it is found only in certain swampy areas in the far southeastern corner of the state (Steyermark). Vines typically grow to 6-10\u2019 tall. Solitary, bell-shaped, pale blue to violet blue flowers with white interiors bloom at the branch ends in late spring to early summer. Flowers are slightly fragrant. Flowers are followed by attractive seedheads. Branches are clad with pinnate compound leaves with broadly ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The flowers of this species have flared, ridged and frilled sepals with strongly recurving tips.Genus name comes from the Greek wordklematiswhich is an old name applied to climbing plants.Specific epithet means closely curled."
