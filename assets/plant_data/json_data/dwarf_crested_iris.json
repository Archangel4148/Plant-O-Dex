    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Iris cristata, commonly called dwarf crested iris, is a low-growing, rapidly spreading plant that typically grows to 3-6\u201d tall. Found growing in rich soil on wooded ravines or bluffs in portions of the eastern and southern United States. In Missouri, it typically occurs on rocky, wooded slopes, on bluffs and along streams in the southeastern Ozark region. It features pale blue, lilac or lavender iris flowers with three parallel, golden, crested ridges on the falls (sepals). Flowers are borne on very short stems, often appearing nearly stemless. Narrow, sword-shaped, yellowish-green to medium green leaves (to 6\u201d long) arise from a network of branching rhizomes. Spreads quickly and forms dense colonies in optimum growing conditions. When in flower, a well-developed bed can produce a spectacular drift of blue color.Genus named for the Greek goddess of the rainbow.Specific epithet means crested, in reference to the crested ridges on the sepals of this species."
