    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Antennaria neglecta, commonly known as field pussytoes, is a small stoloniferous, mat-forming, herbaceous perennial of the composite family.  It is native to dry fields, plains, slopes, grasslands, and open woodlands from Maine to Montana south to Colorado, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee and North Carolina.  It is found in all Canadian provinces plus the Northwest Territories, but is absent from the Yukon and Nunavut Territories.Stems, leaves and clustered flower heads are woolly.  Leaves are of two kinds: (1) basal leaves (each leaf to 2\u201d long and 1/2\u201d wide) in rosettes, with each leaf having a pointed tip, curved edges, a narrow tapered base and a single vein underneath, and (2) much smaller linear leaves arranged alternately along each flower stalk.  In spring, a flower stalk rises from the center of each basal rosette to 8-12\u201d tall bearing crowded terminal clusters of fuzzy, 1/4-inch wide, white disk flowers (petal-like rays absent) in flower heads which purportedly resemble pussy toes.  Each flower cluster has over 20 small unscented flower heads.  Plants are dioecious (male and female flowers on separate plants).  Fruits on female plants are seed-like achenes, with the fruiting heads resembling the fruiting heads of miniature dandelions.This plant is very similar in appearance toAntennaria plantaginifoliaexcept for being somewhat smaller and sporting narrower single-ribbed basal leaves.Field pussytoes is a host for the American painted lady butterfly caterpillar.Genus name comes from the Latin wordantennawhich means yard of a sailing ship in apparent reference to the bristle-like hairs on the flower heads purportedly resembling the antennae of some insects.Specific epithet from Latin means overlooked or slighted in probable reference to the manner which these plants blend into the landscape.Common name of field pussytoes refers to the common native plant habitat of fields and the purported resemblance of flower clusters to the soft pads of a cat\u2019s paw.
