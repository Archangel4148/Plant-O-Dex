    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Genus name comes from the Greek wordskephalemeaning \"head\" andanthosmeaning \"flower\".Buttonbush is a somewhat coarse, deciduous shrub with an open-rounded habit that typically grows 6-12\u2019 (infrequently to 20\u2019) tall. It is common throughout Missouri, most frequently occurring in wet open areas, low woods, thickets, swamps, upland sink-hole ponds, river bottomland and stream/pond margins (Steyermark). Tiny, tubular, 5-lobed, fragrant white flowers appear in dense, spherical, long-stalked flower heads (to 1.5\u201d diameter) in early to mid-summer. Long, projecting styles give the flower heads a distinctively pincushion-like appearance. Flower heads are very attractive to hummingbirds, butterflies, and other insect pollinators. Flower heads mature into hard spherical ball-like fruits consisting of multiple tiny two-seeded nutlets. Fruiting heads usually persist throughout the winter. Ovate to elliptic glossy bright green leaves (to 6\u201d long) are in pairs or whorls. Leaves emerge late in spring."
