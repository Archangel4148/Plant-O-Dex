    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Sedum ternatum, commonly called three-leaved stonecrop (also commonly called whorled stonecrop), is a small, spreading, Missouri native perennial which typically occurs in damp locations along stream banks, bluff bases and stony ledges (as in stonecrop). Grows 3-6\" high and spreads by creeping stems which root at the nodes. Stems break away and die in winter, leaving newly rooted plants separated from the mother plant. Features small, rounded, fleshy, succulent-like leaves (to 3/4\" long) which appear in whorls of three, thus giving rise to the common names. Clusters of tiny white, star-like flowers (to 1/2\" wide) with purplish stamens appear on erect stems above the foliage in spring.Genus name comes from the Latin wordsedeomeaning to sit in reference to the general growing habit of many of the sedums (they sit and sprawl over rocks).Specific epithet means in threes and is in reference to the leaves which appear in whorls of three."
