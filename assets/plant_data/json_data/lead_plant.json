    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Amorpha canescens, commonly called called lead plant, is a Missouri native that typically occurs in open woodlands, glades and prairies. This pea/bean family member is a somewhat ungainly, deciduous shrub growing 1-3' tall and featuring slender, dense, 4-8\" spike-like clusters of tiny, bluish-purple flowers with gold anthers which bloom in May-June. It also features alternate, pinnately compound leaves with grayish green leaflets and densely hairy twigs.Genus name comes from the Greek wordamorphosmeaning shapeless or deformed in reference to the corolla of this pea family genus lacking wings and a keel.Specific epithet means with off-white or ashy-grey hairs in reference to the leaves and twigs.The genusAmorphais often called false indigo because of its resemblance to plants of the genusIndigofera. Common name of lead plant refers to the once held belief that the plant was an indicator of the presence of lead in the ground."
