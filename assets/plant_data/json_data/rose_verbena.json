    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Glandularia canadensisis commonly called rose verbena, clump verbena or rose vervain.  It is a Missouri native perennial that typically occurs in prairies, fields, pastures, rocky glades, roadsides and waste areas in the central and southern parts of the State (Steyermark).  It is a clumping, sprawling plant that grows to 6-18\u201d tall, and can spread rather quickly by pubescent, decumbent stems, rooting at the nodes where they touch the ground, to form an attractive ground cover.  Flat-topped clusters of 5-petaled, rose-pink to rose-purple flowers appear atop ascending stems in a long, late spring to late summer bloom.  Deeply lobed dark green leaves (to 4\" long) have triangular bases.For many years,Glandularia canadensiswas known asVerbena canadensis.   Many prestigious authorities (e.g., The Royal Horticultural Society) still list the plant asVerbena canadensis.  The revised edition of Steyermark's Flora of Missouri (Yatskievych and Turner) now lists the plant asGlandularia canadensis.Glandulariais considered by many authorities to be a genus that is separate and distinct fromVerbenabased upon a number of factors including plant morphology, chromosome number, style length, reproductive modes and ploidal levels (see Umber, The GenusGlandularia(Verbenaceae) in North America, 1979).Genus name from Latin means acorn in probably reference to the shape of the seedpod.Specific epithet means of Canada.
