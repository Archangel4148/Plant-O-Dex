    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Chelone oblique, commonly known as turtlehead, is a stiffly erect, clump-forming perennial that typically grows 2-3\u2019 tall.  It is native to moist woods, swampy areas, floodplains, alluvial forests and stream margins in parts of the Midwestern and Eastern U.S. from Minnesota to Virginia south to Mississippi and Florida.  Hooded, snapdragon-like, two-lipped flowers (each to 1.5\u201d long) ranging in color from red to pink to deep rose bloom in tight, spike-like terminal racemes from late summer into autumn (late July \u2013 September).  Each flower has a sparse pale yellow beard inside the lower lip.  Flowers purportedly resemble the heads of open-mouthed turtles.  Pairs of opposite, coarsely-toothed, lance-shaped, dark green leaves appear in pairs along the stem.Genus name comes from the Greek wordchelonemeaning tortoise in reference to the turtlehead shape of the flowers.Specific epithet means lopsided or oblique."
