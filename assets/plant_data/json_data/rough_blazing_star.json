    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Liatris aspera, commonly called rough blazing star, is an upright, clump-forming, Missouri native perennial which typically grows 2-3' tall (less frequently to 5') and which commonly occurs in dryish soils on prairies, open woods, glades, meadows and along roads and railroad tracks. Features rounded, fluffy, deep rose-purple flower heads (each 3/4\" across) which are crowded into long, terminal flower spikes atop erect, rigid, leafy flower stalks. Stalks arise from basal tufts of rough, very narrow, lance-shaped leaves (to 12\" long). Flowers open somewhat at the same time, which makes this species a particularly good fresh cut flower for floral arrangements. Blooms later (late summer to fall) than most otherLiatrisspecies. The flowers are attractive to hummingbirds, butterflies, and other pollinators, and the small seeds are attractive to songbirds.Genus name of unknown origin.Specific epithet means rough.Liatrisbelongs to the aster family, with each flower head having only fluffy disk flowers (resembling \"blazing stars\") and no rays. The feathery flower heads of liatris give rise to another common name of gayfeather."
