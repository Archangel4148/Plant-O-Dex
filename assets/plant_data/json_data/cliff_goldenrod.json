    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Solidago drummondii, commonly called cliff goldenrod, is a Missouri native perennial which, as the common name suggests, is found on cliffs, bluffs and ledges throughout the Ozark region of the State. Typically grows 1.5-3' tall on arching stems. Panicles of tiny, bright yellow, daisy-like flowers typically with 3-7 rays per head appear on short branches at the stem ends in late summer to fall. Leaves (to 3.5\" long) are ovate, toothed, hairy below and at least 3-veined. Basal leaves generally dry up and disappear by flowering time. Goldenrods have been wrongfully accused of causing hay fever which is actually an allergic reaction to wind-borne pollen from other plants such as ragweed. Goldenrods are attractive to bees and butterflies.Genus name comes from the Latin wordssolidusmeaning whole andagomeaning to make in reference to the medicinal healing properties of some species plants.Specific epithet honors Scottish botanist and naturalist Thomas Drummond (1790-1835)."
