    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Quercus muehlenbergii, commonly called Chinkapin (or Chinquapin) oak, is a medium sized deciduous oak of the white oak group that typically grows 40-60\u2019 (less frequently to 80\u2019) tall with an open globular crown. It is native to central and eastern North America where it is typically found on dry upland sites often in rocky, alkaline soils. Insignificant monoecious yellowish-green flowers in separate male and female catkins appear in spring as the leaves emerge. Fruits are small oval acorns (to 3/4\u201d long), with scaly cups that extend to approximately 1/2 the acorn length. Acorns are valued food for a variety of wildlife. Narrow, oblong-lanceolate, shiny green leaves (4-7\u201d long) have coarse marginal teeth. Leaves somewhat resemble the leaves of chestnut (Castanea) whose nut is sometimes called a chinquapin, hence the common name of this oak whose acorn is sweet and edible. Also sometimes commonly called yellow chestnut oak. Fall color is variable, but usually undistinguished shades of yellow and brown.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for oak trees.Specific epithet honors Gotthilf Henry Ernest Muhlenberg, 18-19th century Lutheran minister-botanist from Pennsylvania."
