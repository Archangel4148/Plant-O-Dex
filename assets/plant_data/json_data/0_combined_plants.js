        "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Celastrus scandens, commonly called American bittersweet, is a deciduous twining woody vine that is best known for its showy red berries that brighten up fall and winter landscapes. This species is native to central and eastern North America including Missouri. In Missouri, bittersweet is typically found in woodland areas, thickets, rocky slopes, bluffs, glade peripheries and along fence rows throughout the State (Steyermark). It is often seen growing along the ground, over and through low shrubs or circling trees in the wild. Berry-laden branches are prized for use as indoor decorations, and collection of the branches in the wild has significantly reduced the wild populations in some areas. Rapidly grows to 20\u2019. It produces serrate, elliptic to ovate, yellowish-green leaves (to 4\u201d long). Staminate and pistillate flowers appear in clusters on separate plants in late spring. Flowers are greenish-white to yellow. Fertilized female flowers give way in summer to spherical orange-yellow fruits. Fruits split open in fall to reveal scarlet fleshy berry-like seeds (arils). Fruits are poisonous if ingested, but are considered to be quite tasty by many birds.Genus name comes from the Greek wordkelastrosfor an evergreen tree.Specific epithet means climbing.In the 1700s, plants were given the name bittersweet by European colonists because their fruits purportedly resembled in appearance the fruits of a Eurasian nightshade (Solanum dulcamara) that was known to them as bittersweet. The common name of false bittersweet also came to be used for the within species to distinguish it from the Eurasian nightshade. American bittersweet is the generally accepted common name that is used today, in large part to distinguish this American native from its aggressive Asiatic relative,C. orbiculatus(Oriental bittersweet) which has escaped cultivation and is naturalizing in parts of eastern and central North America."

It is native to the eastern and central U.S., most frequently found in moist woods, forest bottomlands and swamp peripheries plus some coastal dunes (e.g., Cape Cod down the Atlantic Coast) from Massachusetts to West Virginia to Ohio to southeastern Missouri south to Texas and Florida.  This species is easily identified because it is the only native U.S. holly with spiny green leaves and bright red berries.  This is the Christmas holly whose berry-laden boughs are typically collected at Christmas time each year for ornamentation (\"decking the halls\" as it were).  Thick, leathery, deep green leaves (2-4\" long) have spiny marginal teeth.  Species is dioecious (male and female flowers are on separate trees).  Greenish-white flowers bloom May-June (male flowers in 3-12 flowered clusters and female flowers solitary or in 2s or 3s).  Bright red or orange fruits (drupes to 1/4- 1/2\" diameter) ripen in fall on pollinated female trees, and persist on the tree through winter.  Birds love the fruit.Genus name comes from the Latin nameQuercus ilexfor holm oak in reference to the foliage similarities (holm oak and many of the shrubs in the genusIlexhave evergreen leaves).Specific epithet means opaque or dull, in reference to the non-lustrous leaf surfaces of species plants (many of the cultivars have more lustrous foliage)."

It is native to Missouri where it is typically found in rich moist woods, valleys, ravine bottoms and rocky slopes along streams throughout the eastern and Ozark regions of the state (Steyermark). Typically grows 20-35' tall. The smooth, gray trunk and larger branches of a mature tree exhibit a distinctive muscle-like fluting that has given rise to another common name of musclewood for this tree. Flowers appear in spring in separate male and female catkins, with the female catkins giving way to distinctive clusters of winged nutlets. Serrated, elliptic-oval, dark green leaves often produce respectable shades of yellow, orange and red in fall. The extremely hard wood of this tree will, as the common name suggests, take a horn-like polish and was once used by early Americans to make bowls, tool handles and ox yokes. Commercial use of hornbeam wood is not practicable, however, due to the limited amount of wood that can be harvested per tree.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name.Specific epithet means of North or South Carolina."

It is native to southern swamps, bayous and rivers, primarily being found in coastal areas from Maryland to Texas and in the lower Mississippi River valley to as far north as the southeast corner of Missouri. In the deep South, it is a familiar sight growing directly in swampy water, often in large strands, with its branches heavily draped with Spanish moss. In cultivation, however, it grows very well in drier, upland soils. Trunks are buttressed (flared or fluted) at the base, and when growing in water, often develop distinctive, knobby root growths (\"knees\") which protrude above the water surface around the tree. Soft, feathery, yellowish-green foliage (1/4\" long, flat needles in two ranks) turns an attractive orange/cinnamon-brown in fall. Rounded, wrinkled, 1 inch diameter, purplish-green cones mature to brown. Heavy, straight-grained, rot-resistant wood has been used for a variety of purposes including barrels, railroad ties and shingles. Closest relative is the dawn redwood (Metasequoia) which is also deciduous. State tree of Louisiana.Genus name comes from the Latin wordTaxusmeaning yew and the Greek wordeidosmeaning resemblance from a similarity of leaf shape.Specific epithet means is two ranks for the needle arrangement."

It is a medium to large sized deciduous oak of the white oak group that typically grows 60-80\u2019 (less frequently to 150\u2019) tall with a broad-spreading, rounded crown. Acorn cups are covered with a mossy scale or bur near the rim, hence the common names. It is native to a variety of habitats in central and eastern North America. Best growth occurs in bottomland soils, particularly in the Ohio River valley. In Missouri, it typically occurs in low woods and stream valleys in the Ozark region, but on dry upland soils in the unglaciated parts of the state north of the Missouri River (Steyermark). Insignificant monoecious yellowish-green flowers in separate male and female catkins appear in spring as the leaves emerge. Fruits are oval acorns (to 1 1/2\u201d long), with fringed, burry cups that extend to approximately 1/2 to 3/4 the acorn length. Acorns are an important source of food for wildlife. Leathery, dark green leaves (6-12\u201d long) with 5-9 rounded lobes are variable in shape, but usually have a pair of deep central sinuses that extend nearly to the midrib giving the leaf a waisted appearance. Fall color is an undistinguished yellow-brown. Twigs sometimes are ridged with corky wings.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for oak trees.Specific epithet comes from the Greek wordsmacromeaning large andcarpameaning fruit in reference to the large acorn size."

Unlike many of the other milkweeds, this species does not have milky-sapped stems. Flowers give way to prominent, spindle-shaped seed pods (3-6\" long) which split open when ripe releasing numerous silky-tailed seeds for dispersal by the wind. Seed pods are valued in dried flower arrangements. Long bloom period from late spring throughout the summer. Flowers are a nectar source for hummingbirds, butterflies and many other pollinators, and leaves are a food source for monarch butterfly larvae (caterpillars).Genus name honors the Greek god Asklepios the god of medicine.Specific epithet means \"tuberous\" in reference to the roots.The common name butterfly weed refers to how attractive this plant is to butterflies. This species is sometimes also called pleurisy root in reference to a traditional medicinal use of the plant roots to treat lung inflammations."

Features large, heart-shaped, densely-overlapping leaves (4-8\" long) which can quickly cover an arbor or trellis with deep green foliage. Blooms in mid to late spring in the St. Louis area. Although the flowers make interesting conversation pieces, they are usually hidden by the dense foliage and are somewhat inconspicuous. Flowers give way to ribbed, tubular seed capsules (to 3\" long) which mature to a grayish-brown in September. The leaves, young stems and flowers of this species are hairy (tomentose as the species name suggests). Very similar toA. macrophyllawhich is native to eastern North America, exceptA. macrophyllais basically glabrous (smooth).Aristolochiais a larval plant for the pipe vine swallowtail butterfly.Genus name comes from the Greek wordsaristosmeaning best andlocheiameaning childbirth or delivery in reference to the fact that plants of some species within this genus (1) have a flower structure which more closely resembles a human fetus in the womb than a pipe, and (2) served in the past as the source of ancient plant preparations used for treatment of pain and infections incident to childbirth.Specific epithet means hairy.Commonly called Dutchman's pipe because the unusual, 2\" long, yellowish-green, curved-trumpet flowers (each flaring at the calyx mouth to form three brownish-purple lobes) superficially resemble Dutch smoking pipes."

Blooms in mid to late summer. Leaves often die back by the time of flowering. Leaves and flower scapes rise directly from the bulbs. All parts of this plant have an oniony smell when cut or bruised. Although the bulbs and leaves of this plant were once used in cooking (stews) or eaten raw, this species of allium is not generally considered to be of culinary value today. Bulbs were also used by early Americans as cough/cold remedies and as insect repellants. Nodding wild onion (Allium cernuum) is similar to this plant in size, culture and general appearance, except, as the common name suggests, the flower umbel nods rather than stands erect.Genus name comes from the classical Latin name for garlic.Specific epithet means star-like in reference to the flower shape."

It is the state tree of Missouri and Virginia.  It blooms in early spring (April) shortly after, but usually overlapping, the bloom period of the redbuds.  The true dogwood flowers are actually tiny, yellowish green and insignificant, being compacted into button-like clusters.  However, each flower cluster is surrounded by four showy, white, petal-like bracts which open flat, giving the appearance of a single, large, 3-4\u201d diameter, 4-petaled, white flower.  Oval, dark green leaves (3-6\u201d long) turn attractive shades of red in fall.  Bright red fruits are bitter and inedible to humans (some authors say poisonous) but are loved by birds. Fruits mature in late summer to early fall and may persist until late in the year.Genus name comes from the Latin wordcornusmeaning \"horn\", possibly in reference to the strength and density of the wood.Cornusis also the Latin name for cornelian cherry (Cornus mas). May also be related to the Greekkerasosmeaning \"cherry\".Specific epithet comes from the Latin wordflosflower in reference to its attractive spring flowers.Common name of dogwood is in probable reference to an old-time use of hard slender stems from this tree for making skewers once known as dags or dogs."

It is native to slopes, rocky bluffs and streambanks from Minnesota and South Dakota south to Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas.  In Missouri, it is primarily found on limestone bluffs along the Current and White Rivers.  It has been widely planted in the eastern U.S. where it has escaped gardens and naturalized.Ovate to rounded, medium green to bluish-green, 3-5 lobed leaves turn dull yellow in fall.  Golden yellow trumpet-shaped flowers appear in racemes in spring and emit a strong clove-like fragrance.  Flowers give way to drooping clusters of large, oval-rounded, shiny black currants which ripen in late season (July in St. Louis).  Fruit can be eaten raw from the shrub or made into juices, jams, jellies, tarts and pies.Ribes odoratumis very closely related toRibes aureum, and is now being listed in some references asRibes aureumvar.villosum.The genus nameRibesis derived from the Arabicribas, the name used forRheum ribes(Syrian rhubarb), an unrelated, wild rhubarb species.

        "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Spiraea alba, commonly called meadowsweet, is an upright, deciduous shrub which grows up to 4' tall and features alternate, narrow, toothed, green leaves and terminal, cone-shaped clusters (3-4\" long) of tiny, white flowers that bloom in the summer. Fruits mature in September. Each fruit contains 5 pod-shaped follicles which dry out and split, thus allowing the seeds to disperse (somewhat like milkweed). Fruits do not have ornamental value. This species of spirea is a native of the eastern and midwestern U.S., but is currently endangered in the state of Missouri. Typically found in the wild on wet prairies, wet river bottom prairies and open ground along streams or lakes.Genus name comes from the Greek wordspeirameaning wreath in reference to the showy flower clusters seen on most shrubs in the genus.Specific epithet means white."

        "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Muhlenbergia capillaris, commonly called pink muhlygrass or pink hair grass, is a clump-forming, warm season, perennial grass that is noted for its attractive summer foliage and spectacular clouds of fall flowers. It is native to prairies, pine barrens, and open woodlands from Massachusetts to Kansas south to Florida and Texas. In Missouri, it most frequently occurs in acidic soils in open woods, glades or openings along roads primarily in central Ozark and western areas south of the Missouri River (Steyermark). Glossy, wiry, thread-like, dark green leaves and stems form an attractive basal clump to 2\u2019 tall. It is the fall flowering, however, that most distinguishes this grass. Masses of airy, open, loosely branched inflorescences (each to 12\u201d long) in pink to pinkish-red float above the foliage in a lengthy fall bloom. Tan seed plumes remain attractive in winter. Plants typically grow to 3\u2019 tall x 3\u2019 wide when in flower.Genus name honors Gotthilf Henry Ernest Muhlenberg (1753-1815), Lutheran pastor in Pennsylvania, U.S.A., distinguished amateur botanist.Specific epithet means fine or hair-like."

        "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Betula nigra, commonly called river birch, is a vigorous, fast-growing, medium-sized, Missouri native deciduous tree which occurs on floodplains, swampy bottomlands and along streams throughout the State. In cultivation, it can be trained as either a single trunk or multi-trunked tree. As a single trunk tree, it develops a pyramidal habit when young, but matures to a more rounded shape typically growing 40-70' tall. Multi-trunked trees form a more irregular crown and are generally considered to be the superior growth habit for this species. Salmon-pink to reddish brown bark exfoliates to reveal lighter inner bark. Leathery, diamond-shaped, medium to dark green leaves (1.5-3.5\" long) with doubly toothed margins turn yellow in fall. Monoecious flowers appear in drooping, brownish male catkins and smaller, upright, greenish female catkins.Genus name is the Latin name for birch.Specific epithet means black."

It is native from Quebec to Minnesota south to Georgia and Texas. In Missouri, it typically occurs on both dry upland wooded slopes and hills and in moist valleys and lowland woods throughout the state (Steyermark). Trunks mature to 2-3\u2019 in diameter. This tree features smooth, medium yellow-green, odd-pinnate, compound leaves, each leaf having 5 (less frequently 7 or 9) finely-toothed, broadly lance-shaped, pointed leaflets. Leaflets range from 3-7\u201d long. Leaves turn yellow to golden brown in fall. Non-showy, monoecious greenish yellow flowers appear in April-May, the male flowers in pendulous catkins (to 3-5\u201d long) and the female flowers in short spikes. Female flowers give way to edible oval-rounded nuts. Each nut is encased in a moderately thick husk which splits open in four sections when ripe in fall. Nuts were an important food source to Native Americans and early settlers, and are commercially sold today. Nuts are attractive to a variety of wildlife. Bark of young trees is gray and smooth, but exfoliates in long strips with age. The exfoliation is more recurved and pronounced than on the similar-in-appearance shellbark hickory (seeC. laciniosa). Hickory wood is often used to cure/smoke meats. It is also an excellent firewood/fuel. The wood is extremely hard and is used to make a variety of products including tool handles, ladders, gun stocks and furniture. Andrew Jackson, 7th president of the U.S., was affectionately known as Old Hickory in recognition of his tough character.Genus name comes from the Greek wordkaryaused for walnut trees.Specific epithet means egg-shaped."

Clusters of tiny, apetalous, aromatic, greenish-yellow flowers bloom along the branches in early spring before the foliage emerges. Dioecious (male and female flowers on separate plants), with the male flowers being larger and showier than the female ones. Flowers of female plants give way to bright red drupes (to 1/2\" long) which mature in fall and are attractive to birds. Female plants need a male pollinator in order to set fruit, however. Drupes are very attractive, but may be hidden by the foliage until the leaves drop. Thick, oblong-obovate, light green leaves (to 5\" long) turn an attractive yellow in autumn. Leaves are aromatic when crushed. The larva (caterpillar) of the spicebush swallowtail butterfly feeds on the leaves of this shrub.Genus name honors Johann Linder (1676-1723), a Swedish botanist and physician.Specific epithet comes from the Arabic vernacular word meaning aromatic gum."

Trunks of mature trees may reach 4-6\u2019 in diameter, usually rising column-like with an absence of lower branching. It is named and noted for its cup-shaped, tulip-like flowers that bloom in spring. Flowers are yellow with an orange band at the base of each petal. Although the flowers are 2\u201d in length, they can go unnoticed on large trees because the flowers appear after the leaves are fully developed. Sometimes the flowers are first noticed when the attractive petals begin to fall below the tree. Flowers are followed by dry, scaly, oblong, cone-shaped brown fruits, each bearing numerous winged seeds. Four-lobed bright green leaves (to 8\u201d across) turn golden yellow in fall. Wood is used inter alia for furniture, plywood, boatbuilding, paper pulp and general lumber. Native Americans made dugout canoes from tuliptree trunks.

Basically a stemless plant which features two downy, heart-shaped to kidney-shaped, handsomely veined, dark green, basal leaves (to 6\" wide). Cup-shaped, purplish brown flowers (1\" wide) appear in spring on short, ground-level stems arising from the crotch between the two basal leaves. Flowers are quite attractive on close inspection, but bloom singly on or near the ground and are usually hidden from view by the foliage. Although not related to culinary ginger (Zingiber officinale), the roots of this plant produce a scent that is reminiscent thereof. Fresh or dried roots were used by early Americans as a ginger substitute, but the plant is not normally used today for culinary purposes.Genus name comes from the Latin and Greek name.Specific epithet means of Canada but also used to cover north-eastern U.S. by early writers."

Dayflower-like green foliage emerges in spring. Foliage lacks the white coating found on some other spiderworts. Three-petaled flowers (to 1.5\u201d diameter), accented by contrasting yellow stamens, are borne in terminal clusters (umbels) atop stiff stems. Flower color varies from rose-red to blue to deep purple. Multiple flower buds form in each cluster, but individual flowers open up only a few at a time, each for only one day, blooming in succession in a relatively short April-May bloom period. This spiderwort is very similar in appearance toTradescantia ozarkana(lighter flower color) andT. virginiana(narrower leaf blade).Genus name honors John Tradescant (1570-1638) and his son John Tradescant (1608-1662), botanists and successive gardeners to Charles I of England."

Pinnately compound leaves (usually with 7-11 leaflets) open as yellowish green, turn bright green in summer and then turn yellow in fall. Intensely fragrant, wisteria-like, white flowers in large, drooping, terminal panicles (10-15\u201d long) will cover a mature tree in late spring. Profuse bloom may occur only once every 2 or 3 years however. New trees may not bloom for the first 8-10 years. Bloom is similar in appearance to that of black locust (Robinia). Flowers give way to flat seed pods (2.5-4\u201d long) that mature in September-October. Species was formerly calledCladrastus lutea.Genus name comes from the Greekkladosmeaning branch andthraustosmeaning fragile for the brittle twigs.Specific epithet means of Kentucky.The wood of this tree contains a yellow dye that distinctively colors the heartwood and gives rise to the common name of yellowwood."

A single, nodding, bell- or lily-shaped yellow flower blooms atop a naked scape sheathed by two glossy, tongue-shaped, tulip-like, basal leaves (to 6\u201d long) in early spring. Petal-like perianth segments are reflexed and often brushed with purple on the outside. Anthers are yellow to brown. Leaves are mottled with brown and purple. It typically grows 4-6\u201d (infrequently to 9\u201d) tall. Flowering plants always have two basal leaves, however colonies frequently have non-flowering plants with only a single leaf. The common name of adder\u2019s tongue is in reference to the tongue-like shape of the flowering shoot as it rises up in spring and the supposed resemblance of the flower to the open mouth of a snake. The common name of trout lily is in reference to the mottled leaves and the appearance of the flowers during trout fishing season. The common name of fawn lily is in reference to the spotted leaves and the supposed resemblance of the two-leaved plant to the upright ears of a fawn. The common name of dog-tooth violet (it grows from tiny corms that purportedly resemble dogteeth and its flowers somewhat resemble violets) is unfortunately quite misleading because this flower is not a member of the violet family.Genus name comes from the Greek worderythronionfromerythrosmeaning red, originally the name for another plant.Specific epithet means of North or South America."
