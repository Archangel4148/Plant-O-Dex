    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Penstemon cobaea, commonly called purple beardtongue, prairie beardtongue, or dew flower, is a clump-forming, herbaceous perennial which occurs on prairies, limestone glades and rocky bluffs in the Great Plains and the Ozark Plateau regions of the south-central United States (including Missouri). Mature plants will typically grow 1-2.5' tall. Features showy, loose, terminal panicles of white to violet to deep purple, 2\" long, tubular flowers atop erect, rigid, downy stems. Flowers bloom in mid-spring and are somewhat larger than most penstemons. The leaves are primarily clasping, lanceolate to elliptic in shape, and will reach up to roughly 4.75\" long and 2\" wide.The genus namePenstemonlikely comes from the Latinpaenemeaning \"almost\" or \"nearly\" and the Greekstemonmeaning \"stamen\". The name may also comes from the Greekpentameaning \"five\" andstemonmeaning \"stamen\". Both refer to the fifth, sterile stamen (staminode) that characterizes members of this genus.The common names of this species refer to the color of the blooms or its native habitat. Dew flower may refer the appearance of the glandular hairs covering the stem and emerging flower buds. Penstemons are sometimes commonly called beardtongues because the sterile stamen (staminode) can be hairy."
