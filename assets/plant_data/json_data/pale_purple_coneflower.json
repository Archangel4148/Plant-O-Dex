    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Echinacea pallida, commonly known as pale purple coneflower,  is a coarse, hairy perennial of prairies, savannahs, glades and open dry rocky woods from Nebraska to Michigan south to Georgia and Texas.  It features narrow, parallel-veined, toothless, dark green leaves (4-10\u201d long) and large, daisy-like flowers with drooping, pale pinkish-purple petals (ray flowers) and spiny, knob-like, coppery-orange center cones.  Flowers appear on rigid stems to 2-3\u2019 (less frequently to 4\u2019) tall over a long summer bloom.  This species is distinguished by (a) thin, extremely-reflexed rays which almost droop straight down and (b) very narrow, parallel-veined leaves which have no teeth. Best flower display is in late June to late July, with sporadic continued bloom into autumn.Genus name ofEchinaceacomes from the Greek wordechinosmeaning hedgehog or sea-urchin in reference to the spiny center cone found on most flowers in the genus.Specific epithet means pale in probable reference to the pale pinkish-purple petals."
