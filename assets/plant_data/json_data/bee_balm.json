    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Monarda bradburiana, commonly called beebalm, is a common Missouri native perennial which occurs statewide in dryish, acidic soils in open, rocky woods and glade margins. A clump-forming, mint family member that grows typically to 1-2' tall. Tubular, two-lipped, pinkish to whitish, purple-spotted flowers appear in dense, globular, solitary, terminal heads atop square stems. Each flower head is subtended by (rests upon) a whorl of showy, purplish-tinged, leafy bracts. Flowers are attractive to bees and butterflies. The toothed, aromatic, oblong, grayish-green leaves (to 4\") may be used in teas. Long summer bloom period. Nomenclature for this plant is somewhat confused because some references assert that this separate species is synonymous withMonarda russeliana.Genus name honors Nicholas Monardes (1493-1588), physician and botanist of Seville."
