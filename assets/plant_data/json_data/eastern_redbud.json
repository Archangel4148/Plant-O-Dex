    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Cercis canadensis, commonly called eastern redbud, is a deciduous, often multi-trunked understory tree with a rounded crown that typically matures to 20-30\u2019 tall with a slightly larger spread.  It is particularly noted for its stunning pea-like rose-purple flowers which bloom profusely on bare branches in early spring (March-April) before the foliage emerges.  This tree is native to eastern and central North America from Connecticut to New York to southern Ontario and the Great Lakes south to Western Texas and Florida.  It is found in open woodlands, thickets, woodland margins, limestone glades and along rocky streams and bluffs throughout Missouri (Steyermark).  Flowers (to \u00bd\u201d wide) bloom in clusters of 4-10.  Flowers are followed by flattened leguminous bean-like dry seedpods (to 2-4\u201d long) that mature to brown in summer. Each pod has 6-12 seeds.  Pods may remain on the tree into winter.  Alternate, simple, cordate, broadly ovate to nearly orbicular, dull green to blue-green leaves (3-5\u201d across) have a papery texture and are short pointed at the tip.  Leaves turn pale yellow to greenish-yellow in fall. The flowers provide an early-season nectar source for hummingbirds. The seeds and flowerbuds are eaten by songbirds. Caterpillars and other insects which feed on redbeds are also a source of food for birds.Genus name comes from the Greek wordkerkismeaning \"weaver's shuttle\" in reference to the resemblance of each seed pod to a weaver's shuttle.Specific epithet is in reference to Canada (southern Ontario) being part of the native range of this tree."
