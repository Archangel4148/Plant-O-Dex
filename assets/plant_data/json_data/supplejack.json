    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Berchemia scandens, commonly known as supple-jack, is a woody vine of the buckthorn family that features tough stems, greenish-white flowers and blue fruits. It is native from Virginia to Missouri south to Florida and Texas. It is typically found in (1) bottomland forests and swampy woods as a twining vine that climbs high into trees and (2) much drier upland limestone glades as a sprawling vine that trails along the ground. Stems have smooth gray-green bark. Ovate to elliptic leaves (to 2.5\" long) have distinctive parallel pinnate veins. Small greenish-white flowers bloom in open terminal clusters in mid to late spring. Flowers give way to blue drupes (each 1/4\" across) which mature in autumn. The mature fruits are consumed by songbirds such as mockingbirds, warblers, and thrushes, game birds including turkey and northern bobwhite, and small mammals.Genus name honors M. Berchem, French botanist of the 17th century.Specific epithet means \"climbing upward\" in reference to the climbing habit of this vine.Supple-jack is the name for a strong pliant walking stick made from a plant such as this vine. Vine stems can also be used to make wicker products, hence the additional common name of rattan vine."
