    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Actaea racemosa, commonly called black cohosh, is an upright, Missouri native perennial which occurs in rocky woods in the Ozark region of the State. It typically grows to a total height (foliage plus flowering spikes) of 4-6\u2019, but under optimum conditions can reach 8\u2019. Small, numerous, creamy white, fragrant flowers appear in late summer to early fall in long, terminal racemes resembling fluffy spires (typically 1-2\u2019 long) rising well above the foliage on wiry stems. Astilbe-like, deeply cut, tripinnate foliage is an attractive deep green. Synonymous with and formerly known asCimicifuga racemosa. All plants in the genusCimicifugahave recently been transferred to the genusActaea.Genus name is the Latin name adopted by Linnaeus from Pliny.Specific epithet refers to the flowers being produced in racemes.The common name of bugbane is in reference to the odoriferous insect repellant properties of this plant. Cohosh comes from an Algonquin word meaning rough in reference to the appearance of plant rhizomes."
