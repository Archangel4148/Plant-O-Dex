    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Cornus alternifoliais a small deciduous tree or large multi-stemmed shrub that typically grows 15-25\u2019 tall with distinctive tiered/layered horizontal branching which is upward-turned at the tips.  It is native to both moist and dry forests, forest margins, stream banks and fields from Newfoundland to Minnesota south to northern Arkansas and through the Appalachians to Georgia and Alabama.  Small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers bloom in flattened cymes (each to 2 1/2\" across) in late spring (May-June).  Flowers give way to bluish-black fruits (drupes) on red stalks.  Fruits mature in late summer.  Elliptic-ovate, medium green leaves (to 3-5\u201d long) turn reddish-purple often tinted yellow or green in fall.  Although the leaves of most species of dogwood are opposite, those of pagoda dogwood are alternate, hence the specific epithet and often used common name of alternate-leaf dogwood.Genus name comes from the Latin wordcornusmeaning \"horn\", possibly in reference to the strength and density of the wood.Cornusis also the Latin name for cornelian cherry (Cornus mas). May also be related to the Greekkerasosmeaning \"cherry\".Specific epithet refers to the alternate arrangement of the leaves.Common name of pagoda dogwood is in reference to the tiered horizontal branching."
