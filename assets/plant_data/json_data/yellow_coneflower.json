    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Echinacea paradoxa, sometimes called yellow coneflower, is the only species in the genusEchinaceato have yellow flowers instead of the usual purple flowers (this being the paradox suggested by the species name). It primarily occurs on glades and prairies in the Ozark regions of Missouri and Arkansas. Features large, daisy-like flowers with drooping yellow to orange-yellow petals (ray flowers) and very large, coppery-brown to chocolate-brown central cones. Best flower display is mid-June to mid-July, sometimes with sporadic continued bloom throughout the summer. Flowers grow on rigid, glabrous stems typically to 3' tall. Smooth, lance-shaped, dark green leaves (4-8\" long) with linear veining. The dead flower stems will remain erect well into the winter and, if flower heads are not removed, are often visited by goldfinches who perch on or just below the blackened cones to feed on the seeds. he Greek wordechinosmeaning hedgehog in reference to the spiny center cone.Genus name ofEchinaceacomes from the Greek wordechinosmeaning hedgehog or sea-urchin in reference to the spiny center cone found on most flowers in the genus.Specific epithet calls attention to the paradox of why this species ofEchinaceahas yellow flowers instead of the usual purple."
