    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Heuchera richardsonii, commonly called prairie alumroot or Richardson's alumroot, is a clump-forming, herbaceous perennial native to portions of the north-central United States and south-central Canada. It can be found growing on prairies, open woodlands, glades, slopes, bluffs, and uplands, often in rocky or sandy soils. Typically features a 12-18\" tall basal clump of heart-shaped, shallow-lobed, long-petioled, green leaves (2-3\" wide) which show some white mottling or purple blush when young, maturing to a more uniform green. Tiny, greenish, bell-shaped flowers in open, airy panicles are borne on slender, wiry stems extending well above the mound of leaves, typically to a height of 18-24\" (infrequently to 3') in spring to early summer. Flower stems and leaf undersides are distinctively hairy.Genus name honors Johann Heinrich von Heucher (1677-1747), physician, botanist and medicinal plant expert at Wittenberg University, Germany.The specific epithetrichardsoniihonors John Richardson (1787-1865), a Scottish naturalist, explorer, and surgeon in the Royal Navy."
