    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Eutrochium fistulosum, commonly called hollow Joe Pye weed, is a tall Missouri native perennial which uncommonly occurs in low moist ground, wet meadows, wet thickets and stream margins mostly in the far southeastern corner of the State. It is an erect, clump-forming perennial which typically grows 4-7' tall and features coarsely-serrated, lance-shaped, dark green leaves (to 12\" long) in whorls of 4-7 (frequently 6) on sturdy green stems which are hollow. Tiny, vanilla-scented, dull pinkish-purple flowers in large, terminal, domed, compound inflorescenses (12-18\" diameter) bloom in mid-summer to early fall. Flowers are very attractive to butterflies. Flowers give way to attractive seed heads which persist well into winter. Hollow Joe Pye weed is similar in appearance to both spotted Joe Pye weed (E. maculatum) and sweet Joe Pye weed (E. purpureum, but is primarily distinguished by its larger leaf whorls and hollow stems which usually lack spotting.Genus name is derived from the Greek wordseumeaning well andtrochemeaning wheel-like in reference to the whorled leaves.Specific epithet means hollow."
