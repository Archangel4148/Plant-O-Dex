    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Spiraea alba, commonly called meadowsweet, is an upright, deciduous shrub which grows up to 4' tall and features alternate, narrow, toothed, green leaves and terminal, cone-shaped clusters (3-4\" long) of tiny, white flowers that bloom in the summer. Fruits mature in September. Each fruit contains 5 pod-shaped follicles which dry out and split, thus allowing the seeds to disperse (somewhat like milkweed). Fruits do not have ornamental value. This species of spirea is a native of the eastern and midwestern U.S., but is currently endangered in the state of Missouri. Typically found in the wild on wet prairies, wet river bottom prairies and open ground along streams or lakes.Genus name comes from the Greek wordspeirameaning wreath in reference to the showy flower clusters seen on most shrubs in the genus.Specific epithet means white."
