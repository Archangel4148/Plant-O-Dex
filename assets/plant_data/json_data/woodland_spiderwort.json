    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Tradescantia ernestiana, sometimes commonly called woodland spiderwort, is a clump-forming perennial that is native to Missouri, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia. In Missouri it is typically found in moist woodland valleys, ravines and slopes in the southwestern corner of the state (Steyermark). It grows to 12-24\u201d tall. Dayflower-like green foliage emerges in spring. Foliage lacks the white coating found on some other spiderworts. Three-petaled flowers (to 1.5\u201d diameter), accented by contrasting yellow stamens, are borne in terminal clusters (umbels) atop stiff stems. Flower color varies from rose-red to blue to deep purple. Multiple flower buds form in each cluster, but individual flowers open up only a few at a time, each for only one day, blooming in succession in a relatively short April-May bloom period. This spiderwort is very similar in appearance toTradescantia ozarkana(lighter flower color) andT. virginiana(narrower leaf blade).Genus name honors John Tradescant (1570-1638) and his son John Tradescant (1608-1662), botanists and successive gardeners to Charles I of England."
