    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Polystichum acrostichoides, commonly called Christmas fern, is a Missouri native fern which occurs in both dry and moist wooded slopes, moist banks and ravines. Typically grows in a fountain-like clump to 2' tall and features leathery, lance-shaped, evergreen (green at Christmas time as the common name suggests) fronds. Stocking shape of the pinnae also suggests Christmas. Crosiers (young fiddleheads) in spring are silvery and scaled. Sori appear on the undersides of the pinnae only at the ends (last 1/3) of the fronds. Evergreen fronds provide good winter interest for the landscape.Genus name comes from the Greek wordspolysmeaning many andstichosmeaning in a row in reference to its spore cases being in rows."
