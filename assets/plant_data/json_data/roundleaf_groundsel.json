    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Packera obovata, commonly called roundleaf ragwort or roundleaf groundsel, is valued for its ability to thrive in shady locations, naturalize rapidly, and produce a long and profuse spring bloom of bright yellow flowers. It is native to rocky wooded hillsides, open rocky glades, limestone ledges, stream banks and moist meadows from Quebec and Ontario south to Texas and Florida. In Missouri it most often is found in the Ozark region in the southern and central part of the State (Steyermark). Flat-topped clusters (corymbs) of daisy-like flowers (3/4\" diameter) with yellow rays and yellow central disks bloom in spring (April-June) atop sparsely-leaved stems rising to 18\" tall. Flowering stems rise from a basal clump of serrate, rounded to spatulate leaves (to 2-4\" long) each of which tapers at the base into a long petiole. Upper stem leaves are much smaller, sessile and pinnately lobed. Synonymous withSenecio obovatus.Genus name honors 20th century North American botanist John G. Packer.Specific epithet means egg-shaped with the broadest end uppermost referring to leaf shape."
