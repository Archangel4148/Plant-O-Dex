It typically grows to 2-4' tall.  Showy daisy-like purple coneflowers (to 5\" diameter) bloom throughout summer atop stiff stems clad with coarse, ovate to broad-lanceolate, dark green leaves. Good fresh cut or dried flower.  The dead flower stems will remain erect well into the winter, and if flower heads are not removed, the blackened cones may be visited by goldfinches or other birds that feed on the seeds.Genus name ofEchinaceacomes from the Greek wordechinosmeaning hedgehog or sea-urchin in reference to the spiny center cone found on most flowers in the genus.Specific epithet means purple."
