A somewhat short-lived, clump-forming perennial which features erect, terminal spikes (racemes) of large, cardinal red flowers on unbranched, alternate-leafed stalks rising typically to a height of 2-3' (infrequently to 4'). Tubular flowers are 2-lipped, with the three lobes of the lower lip appearing more prominent than the two lobes of the upper lip. Finely-toothed, lance-shaped, dark green leaves (to 4\" long). Late summer bloom period. Flowers are very attractive to butterflies and hummingbirds, but not cardinals. White and rose colored forms are also known.Genus name honors Matthias de l'Obel (1538-1616), French physician and botanist, who with Pierre Pena wroteStirpium Adversaria Nova(1570) which detailed a new plant classification system based upon leaves.Specific epithet means scarlet or cardinal red.Common name is in reference to the red robes worn by Roman Catholic cardinals."
