    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Solidago speciosa, commonly called showy goldenrod, is a rhizomatous, Missouri native perennial which typically occurs in dry soils in open woods, fields and prairies throughout most of the State except the Ozark region. Features tiny, bright yellow flowers borne in dense, erect, club-shaped terminal clusters atop stiff, narrow-leaved, reddish stems typically growing 2-3' tall. Flowers bloom mid to late summer. As the common name suggests, this species is one of the showiest of the many goldenrods. Goldenrods have been wrongly accused of causing hay fever which is actually an allergic reaction to wind-borne pollen from other plants such as ragweed. Attractive to bees and butterflies.Genus name comes from the Latin wordssolidusmeaning whole andagomeaning to make in reference to the medicinal healing properties of some species plants.Specific epithet means showy."
