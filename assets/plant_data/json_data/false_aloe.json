A rhizomatous perennial which forms large, basal rosettes of nearly flat, soft, fleshy, sword-shaped, dark green leaves (6\" to 20\" long and 2\" wide). Leaves may be flecked with red. From the center of each rosette rises an erect flower stalk to 4-5' tall (less frequently to 6'). Up to 30 solitary, fragrant, pale yellowish-green, tube-shaped, three-lobed flowers (1\" long) are loosely arranged on the flower spike. Long summer bloom occasionally extends into fall. Flowers give way to capsule-like fruit. This plant is also sometimes sold asAgave virginica.Genus name honors Manfredus de Monte Imperiali, an ancient writer.Specific epithet means of Virginia."
