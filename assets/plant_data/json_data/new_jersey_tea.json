It is native to Missouri where it occurs in prairies, glades, dry open woods and thickets throughout the state (Steyermark). Cylindrical clusters (1-2\" long) of tiny, fragrant, white flowers (1/8\") appear on long stalks at the stem ends or upper leaf axils in late spring. Toothed, broad-ovate, medium to dark green leaves (to 4\" long) are gray and hairy below. Young twigs are noticeably yellow and stand out in winter.Genus name comes fromkeanothoswhich is an ancient Greek name relating to some plants in the buckthorn family.Specific epithet means from America, North or South.Dried leaves were used as a tea substitute, albeit without caffeine, in American Revolutionary War times, hence the common name."
