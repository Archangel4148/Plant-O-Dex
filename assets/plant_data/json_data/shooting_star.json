    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Dodecatheon meadia, commonly called shooting star, is a much beloved, native Missouri wildflower that is indigenous to much of the eastern United States and typically occurs in open woods and glades, rocky wooded slopes, bluff ledges, meadows and prairies. From each basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves come 1-4 sturdy, leafless, center flower scapes rising to 20\" tall. Atop each flower scape is an umbel containing 8-20, nodding, 1\" long flowers. Each flower has five swept-back (reflexed) petals and a cluster of yellow stamens converging to a point, thus giving the flower the appearance of a shooting star plummeting to earth. Flower colors are quite variable, ranging from white to pink to light purple. Blooms in late spring.Genus name comes from the Greek wordsdodekameaning twelve andtheosmeaning god.Specific epithet honors English physician Richard Mead (1673-1754)."
