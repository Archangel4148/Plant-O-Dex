    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Antennaria parlinii, commonly known as pussytoes, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern and central North America.  It is very similar in appearance toAntennaria plantaginifolia, with the main difference being larger flower heads.  It is a stoloniferous, mat-forming plant, with the leaves and flower stalks being woolly and grayish.  Somewhat non-showy, fuzzy, whitish flower heads bloom in spring.  Flowers are crowded into terminal clusters (corymbs) atop downy, small-leaved flowering stems rising to 10\u201d high from a basal rosette of paddle-shaped leaves (to 3\u201d long).  Plants are dioecious (male and female flowers on separate plants), with male flowers (yellow stamens) typically appearing on shorter flower stalks than the female flowers (pink stamens).Genus name comes from the Latin wordantennawhich means yard of a sailing ship in apparent reference to the bristle-like hairs on the flower heads purportedly resembling the antennae of some insects.Commonly called pussytoes because of the supposed resemblance of each tight flower cluster to the soft pads of a cat\u2019s paw."
