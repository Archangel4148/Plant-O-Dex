    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Hibiscus laevis, commonly called smooth rose mallow or halberd-leaved rose mallow, is a Missouri native herbaceous perennial which typically occurs in wet soils along streams, rivers, ponds, sloughs, ditches and swampy areas throughout much of the State. Perhaps most easily distinguished by its three-lobed leaves (to 6\" long) which resemble the shape of the 15th-16th century halberd spear. Large, 5-petaled, hollyhock-like flowers (to 6\" diameter) with white to pink petals and maroon eyes appear from mid-summer into fall on smooth stout stems rising 4-6' tall. Each flower has a prominent and showy center staminal column. Synonymous with and formerly known asHibiscus militaris, the specific epithet being in reference to the leaf-shape resemblance to a military weapon.Genus name is the old Greek and Latin name for mallow.Specific epithet means smooth."
