Daisy-like single flowers (2\" diameter) with star-like involucre bracts feature yellow rays (lobed or notched at the tips) surrounding a darker golden yellow center disk.  Flowers typically bloom from late spring to late summer and sometimes into fall, though bloom period can be much shorter if spent flowers are not regularly deadheaded.The genus name comes from the Greek wordskorismeaning \"bug\" andopsismeaning \"like\" in reference to the shape of the seed which resembles a bug or tick.Specific epithet from Latin means hairy in reference to the pubescent leaves and stems.Common name of star tickseed is in reference to the star-shaped involucre bracts and resemblance of the seeds to ticks."
