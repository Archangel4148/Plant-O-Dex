    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Physocarpus opulifolius, commonly called ninebark, is an upright, spreading, somewhat coarse, deciduous, Missouri-native shrub which is closely related to the genusSpiraea.  In Missouri, it typically occurs along streams, rocky banks, gravel bars and in moist thickets, especially in counties south of the Missouri River (Steyermark).  Grows 5-9\u2019 tall (less frequently to 10\u2019).  Noted for its exfoliating bark (on mature branches) which peels in strips to reveal several layers of reddish to light brown inner bark (hence the common name of ninebark).  Bark provides winter interest, but is usually hidden by the foliage during the growing season.  Features small pink or white, five-petaled flowers appearing in dense, flat, rounded, 1-2\u201d diameter, spirea-like clusters (corymbs) in late spring.  Flowers give way to drooping clusters of reddish fruit (inflated seed capsules).  Ovate to rounded, usually 3-5 lobed leaves (to 4\u201d long) are dull green in summer changing to an undistinguished yellow in fall.Genus name comes from the Greekphysameaning a bladder andkarposmeaning fruit, referring to the inflated dry fruits of the plant.Specific epithet refers to the leaves that resemble those ofViburnum opulus.Common name of ninebark is in reference to its ornamental attractive exfoliating bark."
