    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Amsonia illustris, commonly called Ozark bluestar or shining blue star, is a Missouri native perennial that most frequently occurs in sandy or rocky soils on gravel bars or along streams in the Ozark region of the state (Steyermark). This is an erect, clump-forming plant that features terminal, pyramidal clusters of 1/2-inch, star-like, soft light blue flowers in late spring atop erect, leafy stems growing 2-3\u2019 tall. Narrow, willow-shaped, leathery, shiny green leaves (to 6\u201d long) may turn an attractive yellow in fall. Very similar in appearance toAmsonia tabernaemontana, except the leaves of the within species are shinier, thicker and more leathery and the seed pods are pendant.Genus name honors Dr. John Amson (1698-1765?), an English physician and amateur botanist who lived and worked in Williamsburg, Virginia during the colonial period.Specific epithet means brilliant or lustrous."
