    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Zizia aptera, commonly called heart-leaved meadow parsnip, is a Missouri native perennial which occurs most often in small colonies in woods, thickets, glades and prairies. Features flat-topped clusters (compound umbels) of tiny yellow flowers in late spring to early summer atop stems growing to 3' tall. Distinguished from other carrot family members by the absence of a flower stalk on the central flower of each umbel. Tripartite, toothed stem leaves. However, the simple, heart-shaped basal leaves best distinguish this species from the similarZizia aureaand give rise to the common name.Genus name honors German botanist Johann Baptist Ziz (d. 1829).Specific epithet means wingless."
