Typically grows 1-2' tall and features tight clusters of tubular (bottle-shaped), deep blue flowers which never open. Flower clusters appear at the tops of the stems or in the upper leaf axils in late summer to early autumn (October in the St. Louis area). Ovate, lance-shaped leaves (to 4\" long) with parallel veins. Sometimes also commonly called closed gentian.Genus name honors King Gentius of Illyria (reign c. 180-168) B.C., who was reputed to have discovered the medicinal virtues of the root of the yellow gentian or bitterwort (G. lutea) from which a tonic bitters is still made.Specific epithet honors English botanical artist Henry C. Andrews (active 1794-1830)."
