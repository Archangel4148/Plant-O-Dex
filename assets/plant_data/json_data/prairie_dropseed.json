    "Noteworthy Characteristics": "Sporobolus heterolepis, called prairie dropseed, is a clump-forming, warm season, perennial grass which typically occurs in prairies, glades, open ground and along railroads in parts of the central and western United States and southern Canada.  Fine-textured, hair-like, medium green leaves (to 20\u201d long and 1/16\u201d wide) typically form an arching foliage mound to 15\u201d tall and 18\u201d wide.  Foliage turns golden with orange hues in fall, fading to light bronze in winter.  Open, branching flower panicles appear on slender stems which rise well above the foliage clump in late summer to 30-36\" tall.  Flowers have pink and brown coloration but are perhaps most noted for their unique and noticeable (some may say pungent) scent that has variously been described as resembling a combination of coriander, popcorn, honey, sunflower seeds, and melted wax.  Tiny rounded mature seeds drop to the ground from their hulls in autumn giving rise to the descriptive common name.The genus nameSporoboluscomes from the Ancient Greeksporosmeaning \"seed\" andballomeaning \"to throw\", in reference to how the seeds are dispersed.Specific epithet means diversely scaled."
